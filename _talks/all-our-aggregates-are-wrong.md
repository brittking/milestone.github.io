## All our aggregates are wrong

Business requirements are seldom as simple as they seem. What happens when the requirements start to get more complex than your original design. Will you be able to adapt? 

When requirements start to get more complex, you may find yourself in a predicament. Do you introduce technical shortcuts (full of code smells) for the sake of delivering on schedule? Or do you rewrite from scratch?

In this presentation, we'll analyze what appears to be a straightforward e-commerce shopping cart. Then we'll add a few more use cases that make it more complex, and see how it can negatively impact the quality of the overall design. Finally, we'll focus our attention on the business needs behind these requriements, and see how it can shed light on the correct approach to designing these features.

In the end, we'll have a new understanding of how to take requirements apart to build the right software.

You'll learn about:

    Basics of vertical slice service architecture
    Strategies for decomposing services into slices
    How services can communicate effectively
    Techniques for combining data from multiple services into a single ViewModel

## Tutti i nostri aggregati sono sbagliati

Inizia sempre tutto bene, il requisito è semplice e l'implementazione procede senza intoppi. Poi i requisiti aumentano e ci ritroviamo con una strana sensazione allo stomaco e con la necessità di introdurre alchimie tecnologiche che non ci piacciono, ma non sappiamo perché. Prenderemo una funzionalità tanto semplice, quanto usata, come il carrello di un e-commerce e proveremo a capire se è veramente così semplice. Guarderemo il problema tecnico che vogliamo risolvere e poi sposteremo l'attenzione sui requisiti di business. Requisiti che una volta compresi a fondo ci porteranno a capire quali sono le vere responsabilità del dominio.
