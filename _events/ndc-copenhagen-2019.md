### All our aggregates are wrong

It always starts well. At first glance the requirements seem straightforward, and implementation proceeds without hiccups. Then the requirements start to get more complex, and you find yourself in a predicament, introducing technical shortcuts that smell for the sake of delivering the new feature on schedule.

In this talk, we'll analyze what appears to be a straightforward e-commerce shopping cart. We'll then go ahead and add a few more use-cases that make it more complex and see how it can negatively impact the overall design. Finally, we'll focus our attention to the business needs of these requirements and see how it can shed light on the correct approach to designing the feature. Walk away with a new understanding on how to take requirements apart to build the right software.

### Workshop: SOA Done Right (with examples in ASP.NET and NServiceBus)

Go beyond the hype and build a solid foundation of theory and practice with this workshop on SOA development.

Join Dennis van der Stelt and Mauro Servienti for a two-day deep dive covering architectural topics like:

- UI decomposition
- Data ownership across the enterprise
- Finding service boundaries

You’ll also learn the nitty-gritty details of building production-ready systems including:

- Fault tolerance – HTTP and queues
- Reliable integration with 3rd party systems
- Scalability, high availability & monitoring

Finally, get some hands-on experience in SOA development by building:

- Scalable command-processing endpoints
- Publish/subscribe event-processing interactions
- Long-running multi-stage business processes and policies

#### Objectives

We’ll understand service oriented architecture concepts, and DDD concepts such as bounded contexts and data ownership.

We’ll apply those concepts to build a simple, yet fully functional, order management system sample with a microservices architecture, using patterns such as command processing, pub/sub and long-running sagas.

#### Skill Level

Senior developers, tech leads, and architects will benefit most from this workshop.

#### Computer setup

Participants are requested to bring a Windows laptop with Visual Studio 2017 and to follow the full set up instructions at least one week before the workshop, available at https://github.com/Particular/Workshop/blob/master/README.md
