### Long live and propser

Microservices all the thing! they say. Nowadays it seems that if architectures are not microservices based they are not worth the name. Is it really true? Do we really need a (micro)services based architecture? Join Mauro in a journey that aims to disclose what it means to build a distributed system based on a (micro)services architecture. We'll analyze most common errors and and we'll see how a different architectural point of view can be a game changer in systems design. Always keeping in mind that our goal are long lasting and prosper systems.
