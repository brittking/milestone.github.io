<span>…fosse sempre così:</span><br>  <blockquote>   <span>Some developers hate seeing bugs. They think bugs indicate a failure on their part—that their code seemed perfect until bugs were found. These developers are called “amateurs.” Real developers know the only reason you haven’t found bugs is that you haven’t looked.</span><br>    <span>I love seeing bugs. It’s better for me to see them than for my customers to see them. What I hate seeing are poorly written bug reports—misleading or generic titles, unclear or missing reproduction steps, exaggerated priority, overstated severity, and inappropriate, cowardly, and poorly documented resolutions.</span><br>    <span>Why can’t people write decent bug reports?</span><br> </blockquote>  <span>Fonte: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eric_brechner/archive/2010/11/01/am-i-bugging-you-bug-reports.aspx">Am I bugging you?
