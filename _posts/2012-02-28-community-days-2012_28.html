<p>Once again I had the pleasure to speak at one of the greatest Italian event: <a href="http://www.communitydays.it/" target="_blank">Community Days 2012</a>.</p>  <p>I <a href="http://www.communitydays.it/events/communitydays-2012/arch02/" target="_blank">gave a talk</a> speaking about that wonderful piece of code that <a href="http://www.nservicebus.com/" target="_blank">NServiceBus</a> is, it has been a real pleasure, thanks everyone for been there and a special thank to the organizers of the event for their perfect job and to Microsoft for hosting us.</p>  <p>Are you ready for the <a href="http://www.communitydays.it/events/communitydaysbari-2012" target="_blank">next step</a>?</p>  <p>.m</p>
