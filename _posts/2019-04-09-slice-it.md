title: "Slice it!"

synopsis: "We desperately strive to achieve autonomy at the back-end, but rarely think about the front-end. Using ViewModel Composition techniques we can achieve autonomy at the front-end as well. It's important to understand why there shouldn't be such a thing as orchestration."

There is no such thing as orchestration. Have you noticed it? Probably no, so far I've intentionally avoided mentioning it. But this doesn't change the fact that there is no such thing as orchestration. Let me stress about it.

The Composition Gateway is totally ignorant about requests handlers and events subscribers that take part in the composition process. There is nothing dictating to anyone what to do. We have an incoming HTTP request and the Composition Gateway has a way to understand which subscribers should be allowed to subscribe to events and which handlers should be invoked. This is it.

> Before diving into this new chapter it's advisable to review what we've talked about so far. All the articles related to ViewModel Composition are available in the [ViewModel Composition category](/categories/view-model-composition.html).

If the Composition Gateway was about to orchestrate anything, for example:

1. I know that there is an incoming request to visualize a product page
2. In order to do so I need to invoke the following services:
   1. *marketing* that owns name and description
   2. *sales* that owns price
   3. *warehouse* that owns availability
   4. *shipping* that owns shipping options
3. Once I have all the data I can compose them into this new document that will be returned to the UI

Even the language suggests coupling. If we give the Composition Gateway knowledge about the scenarios we'll end up with tight coupling: every single time we need to change the way something is displayed, we'll have to touch the Composition Gateway.

## Vertical slices

One of the goal of designing systems using, for example Services Oriented Architectures, is to build a system where logical services are well isolated from each other. In our sample scenario we've already identified 4 services:

![1554816278658](/img/posts/slice-it/1554816278658.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Each one owning a specific set of data. We can now easily "vertically" expand those boxes and allow each service to the best, or the required, technical solution they need to fulfill business requirements:

![1554816452773](/img/posts/slice-it/1554816452773.png){:class="img-fluid"}

For example:

* *Marketing* can decide that their best bet is to go with a document oriented database that exposes an HTTP layer that can be directly queried from the UI. And for security reasons they'll have a reverse proxy in front of it to handle non-authenticated requests.
* *Sales* and *Warehouse* can decide to have a set of back-end services, proxied by a web API layer, both talking to a traditional RDBMS.
* And finally *Shipping* could be outsourced to a third party system, and thus all what we build is a web API that acts like a proxy to the third party system

By removing any orchestration from the Composition Gateway we can push these vertical slices even further into the UI territory:

![1554817043210](/img/posts/slice-it/1554817043210.png){:class="img-fluid"}

Thanks to ViewModel Composition techniques, services can now own also part of the UI, if not all.

But there is one more little thing we can gain: If services own the full vertical slice, they can introduce caching and even read models. Inside service boundaries:

![1554817239984](/img/posts/slice-it/1554817239984.png){:class="img-fluid"}

## Conclusion

I personally find it interesting to see how encapsulation and the single responsibility principle, that are usually brought up in the context of code design can be applied at a much higher level. Vertical slices are a way to apply encapsulation and the single responsibility principle to services. Once we have full encapsulation each service can make decisions, being them business or technical doesn't really matter, without affecting, or worse breaking, any other service in the system. We will talk more about read model in the context of a single service in the future.
