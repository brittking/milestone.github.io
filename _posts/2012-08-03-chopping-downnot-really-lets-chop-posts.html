<p>I write really long blog posts, they are useless in the end, because you (the reader) end up being tired in the middle of the post, and, worse, if posts are technically complex you get tired even before reaching the middle of the post.</p> <p>So…the good news is that from now on I’ll try to write shorter posts, may be divided into “parts”: the next post originally thought as a single article is under heavy refactoring and will be chopped up into 8 parts…imagine how long it was :-/</p> <p>let’s see if I can respect my readers and my own proposals.</p> <p>.m</p>
