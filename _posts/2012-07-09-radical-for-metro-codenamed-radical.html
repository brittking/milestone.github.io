In the long term the aim is to give to the Metro developer all the facilities that Radical gives to the WPF and Silverlight developer.</p> <p>State of the art at the moment of this writing is:</p> <ol> <li>The inversion of control container <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-03-22-inversion-of-control-on-phone %}" target="_blank">built for the Phone</a> has been ported to Metro;</li> <li>The Model View ViewModel toolkit has been fully ported to Metro and the development of new Metro app from scratch takes a couple of minutes;</li> <li>A new NavigationService is under development due to the fact that the built-in Frame is not really MVVM friendly;</li> <li>The whole Change Tracking infrastructure has been ported to Metro so View Models can benefit of this goodie;</li> <li>WeakEvents have been introduced to support the monitoring infrastructure already present in the Radical Windows toolkit;</li> <li>Since, I hope currently, the XAML for Metro lacks the concept of behaviors I have build my own behavior infrastructure that behaves really similar to the Blend one, even if with much less features;</li></ol> <p>Currently I’m working on 3 big features:</p> <ol> <li>UI Composition for Metro;</li> <li>Complete the NavigationService infrastructure, stealing some concepts from the MVC routing engine;</li> <li>Provide an easy to use API to manage the state of the application across suspend/resume state changes;</li></ol> <p>As usual the <a href="http://radical.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">whole source</a> code is hosted on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">CodePlex</a>, in the “metro” branch.</p> <p>.m</p>
