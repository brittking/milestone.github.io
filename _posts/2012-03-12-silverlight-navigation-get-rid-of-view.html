<a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/" target="_blank">PostSharp</a> is a must have (period).<br />
<strong>Let’s start from the beginning</strong><br />
I’m building a sample application for a friend in order to see if it is possible to have a completely OOB and offline Silverlight application running on a Mac using a document database (<a href="http://ravendb.net/" target="_blank">RavenDB</a> in this case, a special version) as backend.<br />
On the other side I’m using the same spike to start the <a href="http://radical.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Radical</a> Presentation Silverlight 5 implementation, if you recall the first time we spoke about it we state that the main pillar should be <strong>simplicity</strong>.<br />
Simplicity, IMHO, means also friction-less and friction-less in a Silverlight application, for example, can be translated to “navigation application” that uses all the out-of-the-box services provided by the Silverlight infrastructure such as the navigation framework.<br />
<strong>Why?</strong><br />
Easy peasy…fast startup is the answer, startup Visual Studio…create a new project and you expect to be up and running just adding a bunch of references.<br />
Well…all the samples I’ve found out there, the majority of them, does 2 main things:<br />
<ul>
<li>some of them get rid of the default navigation framework and start building their own…  </li>
<li>some of them use the built-in services and introduce that piece of crap called “view-model-locator”…  </li>
<li>some of them does both of the above… :-/ </li>
</ul>
<strong>view-model-locator: why I hate you?</strong><br />
Basically the main reason is that <em>view-model-locator</em> sounds too much like <em>service-locator</em> that for me is pure evil…view-model-locator is everything other then friction-less, you introduce a class, with pure stupid properties, for the only purpose of linking the view and the view model in a view first scenario where you do not have any control on the view creation (the navigation infrastructure has it).<br />
<strong>So?</strong><br />
If you remember some time ago we spoke about the ability, using PostSharp, to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-09-20-c-typeloaderinterceptor %}" target="_blank">intercept the instantiation</a> of a class. Why not using that really simple type load interceptor to do something like:<br />
<blockquote>
<pre style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Consolas;"><span style="color: #2b91af;"><span style="font-size: 11.3pt;">TypeLoader</span></span><span style="font-size: 11.3pt;">.Engine.AddInterceptor( <span style="color: blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: #2b91af;">DelegateTypeLoadInterceptor</span>()
{
 IsInterestedInHandler = ( o, m ) =&gt;
 {
  <span style="color: blue;">return</span> m == <span style="color: #2b91af;">TypeLoadMomentum</span>.AtConstructorExit &amp;&amp; o <span style="color: blue;">is</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: #2b91af;">Page</span> &amp;&amp; o.GetType().Name.IsLike( <span style="color: #a31515;">"*View"</span> );
 },
 
 InterceptHandler = ( o, m ) =&gt;
 {
  <span style="color: blue;">var</span> viewType = o.GetType();
  <span style="color: blue;">var</span> aName = <span style="color: blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: #2b91af;">AssemblyName</span>( viewType.Assembly.FullName );
  <span style="color: blue;">var</span> vmTypeName = <span style="color: #2b91af;">String</span>.Format( <span style="color: #a31515;">"{0}.{1}Model, {2}"</span>, viewType.Namespace, viewType.Name, aName.FullName );
  <span style="color: blue;">var</span> vmType = <span style="color: #2b91af;">Type</span>.GetType( vmTypeName, <span style="color: blue;">true</span> );
 
  <span style="color: blue;">var</span> p = ( <span style="color: #2b91af;">Page</span> )o;
  p.DataContext = container.Resolve( vmType );
 }
} );</span></span></pre>
</blockquote>
we basically say:<br />
<ol>
<li>every time a view, that is a Page, and whose name ends with “View” is instantiated we are interested in intercept the constructor at the end of the instantiation process; 
</li>
<li>we use a convention to determine the view model type name given the view type name; 
</li>
<li>we resolve the view model using our favorite IoC container; </li>
</ol>
Finally we wire up everything using this single line of code:<br />
<blockquote>
<pre style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Consolas;"><span style="font-size: 11.3pt;">[<span style="color: blue;">assembly</span>: <span style="color: #2b91af;">InterceptTypeLoad</span>( AttributeTargetTypes = <span style="color: #a31515;">"*.Presentation.*View"</span> )]</span></span></pre>
</blockquote>
Now we can leverage the Silverlight built-in navigation services without any pain and much more important without any friction.<br />
If you want to give it a try you can simply use <a href="http://nuget.org/" target="_blank">nuget</a> to grab a reference to <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Radical.Extensions.Aspects" target="_blank">Radical.Extensions.Aspects</a> that now supports also Silverlight 5.<br />
