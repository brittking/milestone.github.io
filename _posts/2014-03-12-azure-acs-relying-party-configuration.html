<p>Every time I do it I do it wrong and it takes me too much time to remember why it is wrong.</p> <p>Let me explain the situation:</p> <ul> <li>Setup a relying party on Azure ACS identified in the following manner:</li> <ul> <li>Realm: <a href="https://mydomain.com/FooBar">https://mydomain.com/FooBar</a></li> <li>Return Url: <a href="https://mydomain.com/FooBar">https://mydomain.com/FooBar</a></li></ul></ul> <p>Everything seems fine and correct…fail…it does not work, when you try the application the result is:</p> <ul> <li>Request to <a href="https://mydomain.com">https://mydomain.com</a>;</li> <li>The authentication process kicks in and redirects to the Azure ACS hosted login page;</li> <li>The use choses the authentication provider and perform the login;</li> <li>The authentication provider redirects back to the ACS that redirects back to your application @ <a href="https://mydomain.com/FooBar">https://mydomain.com/FooBar</a>;</li> <li><strong>HTTP 405, Method Not Allowed</strong> :-\</li></ul> <p><strong>Can you spot the bug?</strong></p> <p>The return Url definition misses the trailing “/”, it must be <a href="https://mydomain.com/FooBar/">https://mydomain.com/FooBar/</a>, but why?</p> <p>Because the process is not so simple as we can expect:</p> <ul> <li>….bla bla bla…</li> <li>The authentication provider redirects back to the ACS that redirects back to your application @ <a href="https://mydomain.com/FooBar/">https://mydomain.com/FooBar/</a> via a <strong>POST request</strong>;</li></ul> <p>When you perform a request to the extension less MVC Url handler the Url handler mst append a trailing / to the Url, if missing, otherwise all the runtime evaluated links on the client side will be wrong, in order to do that the handler can only perform a redirect to the same Url with the “/” appended, a redirect is generally dropped and not honored if the HTTP verb is POST, and for a good reason.</p> <p>.m</p>
